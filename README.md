## üõ°Ô∏è How the Backend Code-Runner Works

1. **User Submits Code**: The user interface sends code (in Python, JavaScript, or Go) and the chosen language to the backend.
2. **Node.js/Express Server**: A dedicated server receives the snippet and orchestrates ephemeral Docker containers.
3. **Docker Container**: The snippet is mounted into a Docker container that already has Python, Node, Go, and the respective Algorand SDKs installed.
4. **Code Execution**: Docker runs the snippet (e.g., `python3 script.py`, `node script.js`, or `go run main.go`). The server captures output or errors.
5. **Result Returned**: Output is sent back to the frontend in real time.

This approach ensures **isolation** (each snippet runs in a fresh environment) and includes **Algorand SDK** capabilities in all three languages for advanced contract interactions.

## üõ°Ô∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mibernard/algolearn.git
   cd algolearn
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   By default, this starts the Next.js frontend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Configure the Backend** (Optional Advanced):
   - If you‚Äôre also running the Docker-based code-runner backend locally, you need:
     1. **Docker** installed.
     2. A suitable Docker image built with `go-algorand-sdk`, `py-algorand-sdk`, and `algosdk`.
   - Ensure environment variables for any external compilers or APIs (Judge0, etc.) are configured.

5. **Access the Application**: Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

<!--
## üîë API Key Setup

To enable the functionality of the embedded code compilers (Judge0, etc.), you need to configure environment variables for API access:

1. **Create a `.env.local` File** in the root directory of the project, not committed to version control.
2. **Add the Following Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Example for Judge0
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=your-rapidapi-key-here
   JUDGE0_HOST=judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com
   JUDGE0_API_URL=https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com/submissions
   ```
3. **Restart the Development Server** to ensure changes take effect.
-->

## üåê Deployment

- The **frontend** is hosted on **Vercel**. Push to the main branch, and Vercel automatically builds and deploys.
- The **Docker-based code-runner** is hosted on a **GCP e2-medium VM** with Docker installed. The Node.js/Express server runs there (via PM2). Adjust your API endpoints to point from the Next.js app to this external service.

## ü§ù Contributing
