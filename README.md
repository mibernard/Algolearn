## 🛡️ Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mibernard/algolearn.git
   cd algolearn
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the Application:** Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## 🔑 API Key Setup

To enable the functionality of the embedded code compilers, you need to configure environment variables for API access. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.env.local` File**:
   In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env.local`. This file will hold your environment variables and should not be committed to version control.
   
2. **Add the Following Variables:** Open .env.local in a text editor and add your API keys and configuration:
   ```
   # API Key for RapidAPI (Judge0)
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=your-rapidapi-key-here

   # Judge0 Host and API URL
   JUDGE0_HOST=judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com
   JUDGE0_API_URL=https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com/submissions
   ```

3. **Secure Your API Keys:** Ensure .env.local is included in your .gitignore file to prevent it from being pushed to version control. This is already handled in the provided .gitignore configuration:
   ```
   # Environment Files
   .env
   .env.local
   ```
4. **Restart the Development Server:** After adding the environment variables, restart your development server to ensure the changes take effect:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Notes for Collaborators:** If you're working with collaborators, share the required keys securely (e.g., via a password manager or secure messaging) and provide the .env.example template included in this repository.

## 🌐 Deployment
  The application is hosted on Vercel. To deploy your changes, push your changes to the main branch. Vercel will automatically trigger a build and deploy the updated application.
